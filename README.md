# BackEnd-CRUD
User CRUD with JavaScript, Express, Prisma, MySQL and Yup

This project consists of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for user management. It will be developed using JavaScript as a programming language, with the Express framework to create the API, and Prisma as an ORM to interact with the MySQL database. The application will allow you to perform basic operations on user data, such as registration, viewing, editing and removal .

Furthermore, the project will implement data validation using the Yup library, ensuring that data sent by users is validated before being processed, which increases the security and reliability of the application.
